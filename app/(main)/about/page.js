              Eva was born in 1990 and grew up in Northwest Washington State.  <br/>  <br/> Her recipe for banana cream pie was dictated to her in a dream; <br/>  <br/>  sometimes intel is received directly and other times there is code to decipher. <br/>  <br/>  Did you know that the songs of cricket nymphs indicate just how warm and pleasant the evening will be? <br/>  <br/>  This sound gets certain people in the mood for love :)  <br/>  <br/> The cricket thermometer method is an old folk trick you can try for yourselfâ€”  <br/>  <br/> count the number of cricket chirps in 14 seconds and add 40. 30 chirps+40=70 degrees Fahrenheit.
